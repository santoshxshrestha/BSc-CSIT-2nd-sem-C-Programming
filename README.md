# BSc-CSIT 2nd Semester: C++ Programming

This repository serves as my personal code archive and learning journey through the C++ Programming course in the second semester of my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Information Technology (BSc-CSIT) program.

## Overview

This repository helps me track my progress, store my code solutions, and document my learning as I work through C++ concepts. It's organized chronologically to show my development from basic syntax to more complex programming concepts.

## Repository Structure

- **Lab Work**: My solutions to lab assignments
- **Practice Code**: Personal exercises and experiments while learning different concepts
- **Class Notes**: Code snippets and examples from lectures
- **Projects**: Implementation of assigned projects and personal coding challenges

## Learning Progress

I'm working through the following topics as part of my BSc-CSIT curriculum:

- C++ Fundamentals and Syntax
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Function Overloading and Operator Overloading
- Templates and Exception Handling
- File Handling
- STL (Standard Template Library)
- Data Structures Implementation in C++

## Development Environment

### My Setup

- Compiler: [g++]
- IDE: [neovim]
- OS: [linux]

### Running My Code

```
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```

## Personal Goals

- Document my learning journey through C++
- Maintain clean, well-commented code for future reference
- Track my progress through the semester
